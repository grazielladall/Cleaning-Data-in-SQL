# Cleaning-Data-in-SQL

The Data Cleaning in SQL project's objective is to show how I use SQL to enhance the data quality, becoming easier to analyse and generate insights. 

On this project, I've used some important data cleaning techniques such as CTE (Common Table Expressions), CONVERT(), and PARSENAME().
